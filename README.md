# mark-serrano
I am currently implementing a website for my friend Mark Serrano, a talented Canadian designer, illustrator and letterer. You can find his current website at http://www.markemilserrano.com/. He is using a basic squarespace-based theme, which does not really give any credit to his amazing works. I have volunteered to re-make his website using HTML, CSS, Sass, Bootstrap 4 and JavaScript. In the long term, I am looking at introducing back-end system to handle picture uploading by Mark, comment addition by users, contact form that sends email to Mark and a shopping cart system with a secure credit card operations interface.

I have produced several mockups of alternative website design and Mark agreed on the one I'm working at the moment. Logo and pictures are subject to copyright of Mark Serrano, Toronto.
